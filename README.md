# Penalised-Logistic-Regression

Comparison of Penalised Logistic Regression with Stepwise Logistic Regression for Yeast Dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yeast.

Found some interesting results:-

With Less variables Stepwise Logistic Regression performs better than Penalised Logistic Regression.
With higher number of variables Penalised Logistic Regression performs better.

Its very clear , this is happening because of multicollinearity among the variables.
